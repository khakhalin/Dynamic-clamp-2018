This repo contains all supplementary materials for the paper Busch Khakhalin 2018 
"Intrinsic temporal tuning of neurons in the optic tectum is shaped by multisensory experience", including:

* [LaTeX version of the paper](main.tex)
* Matlab code used to analyze the data
* R code used to analyse the data
* TSV tables of the data. While raw recordings cannot be hosted here, we tried to post as much data as we could.

The workflow we used for the project is described below.
