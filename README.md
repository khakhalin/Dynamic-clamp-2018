## Abstract

Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity is often described as an adjustment of neuronal excitability to maintain stable spiking output. Here we report that intrinsic plasticity in the tectum of Xenopus tadpoles also supports temporal tuning, wherein neurons independently adjust spiking responses to fast and slow patterns of synaptic activation. Using the dynamic clamp technique, and five different types of visual, acoustic, and multisensory conditioning, we show that in tadpoles exposed to light flashes, tectal neurons became selective for fast synaptic inputs, while neurons exposed to looming and multisensory stimuli remained responsive to longer inputs. We also report a homeostatic co-tuning between synaptic and intrinsic temporal properties in tectal cells, as neurons that naturally received fast synaptic inputs tended to be most responsive to long-lasting synaptic conductances, and the other way around. These results expand our understanding of plasticity in the brain, and inform future work on the mechanisms of sensorimotor transformation.
