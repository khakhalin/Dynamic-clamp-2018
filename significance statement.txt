With the explosion of work in connectomics, most researchers concentrate on the topology of neural connections, rather than on differences in neuronal tuning. Here in a midbrain sensory network we show that neurons are temporally tuned to synaptic inputs of different duration. This tuning is weekly coordinated with the actual dynamics of synaptic inputs each cell receives, and can is strongly shaped by sensory experience.
